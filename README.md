## AttentionTrip Data Evaluation

I have taken a data set from another class in which we conducted a replication experiment of the AttentionTrip Game.
In this data evaluation I use what I have learned in this class to clean the data, and produce some usefull graphs. 

This project is still a work in progress and I plan to continue to work on the data and eventually produce some statistical analysis.


This experiment was run as an ipad 'game' which tests for function of three attentional networks: alerting, orienting, and executive function.
#### The essential variables you need to know are: 
 - Subjects were told to bias towards accuracy or reaction time. (N = 12; acc = 5, RT = 7)
 - An alerting tone was played on some trials: Present or Absent.
 - Some trials were visually cued: Present or Absent (cues were always 100% accurate of target position)
 - Three flanker conditions: Congruent, Incongruent, or None. (Congruent/Incongruent to the color of target)
