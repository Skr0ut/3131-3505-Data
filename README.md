# Portfolio-1: Max Mascini
This is my submission for my Portfolio

I have taken a data set from another class in which we conducted a replication experiment of the AttentionTrip Game.
This experiment was run as an ipad 'game' which tests for function of three attentional networks: alerting, orienting, and executive function.
If you are interested in reading the article of which this experiment was based please click [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.07.008)


In this portfolio I use what I have learned in this class to clean the data, and produce some usefull graphs.
